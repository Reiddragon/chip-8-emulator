# CHIP-8 Emulator
A CHIP-8 emulator written in C and Allegro 5

The emulator is *mostly* complete, failing some test ROMs but it shouldn't be
anything too crazy to fix, altho focusing on other larger projects now so it'll
prob be a while before I can come back to this and fix it

## Building
A C99 compiler and [Allegro 5](https://liballeg.org/) are all you need, once
you got them installed, just run [install.sh](install.sh) and you're done
